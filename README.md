## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ouest-France/platform.git
npm install
```

## Getting started


* [BlockProvider Development Guide (FR)](/BlockProvider-guide-fr.md)
* [BlockProvider Tutorial using Java](/packages/blockprovider-tutorial-parkings)
* [Sample of BlockProvider using NodeJS](/packages/blockprovider-example)
* [Schemas documentation](/packages/documentation)


## Rules

- A block should not have its own CSS, JS, fonts but leverage [SipaUI components](https://github.com/Ouest-France/SipaUI)

... if you really have to (and hope to pass our platform validation team)

- Every CSS class names & ids must be prefixed by your block-provider name.
- JavaScript code must not conflict with other code. Don't use global variables, your code will be wrapped inside a [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE).
- A block's JavaScript files will be concatenated and loaded asynchronously.
- A block-provider should respond in less 150ms. If it doesn't, your block won't be rendered .
- A block must be responsive (no fixed width).

## How do I update my block?

Blocks are immutable â€” including their parameters configuration/templates/CSS/JS/fonts assets. If you update any part of it (e.g. change a CSS, a parameter, a template), you will need to update the version number (follow [semver](https://semver.org)) and submit again the block-provider to the platform for validation.
